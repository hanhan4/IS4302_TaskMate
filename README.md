## Device Management and Task Validation Smart Contract
This repository contains the Device Management and Task Validation Smart Contract, written in Solidity. It provides a decentralized system for managing devices, granting/revoking access, task scheduling, and rewarding or penalizing users based on task completion.

# Features
1. User Management
Register Users: Users can register with a unique username and associate their account with an IPFS CID.
Balance Tracking: Users have a balance that is updated based on rewards/penalties.
Rating System: Tracks user ratings for completed tasks.

2. Device Management
Add Devices: Users can add devices they own.
Grant/Revoke Access: Owners can grant or revoke access to their devices for other users.

3. Request and Task Management
Create Requests: Users can send requests to device owners, specifying access duration, schedules, and tasks.
Approve/Reject Requests: Device owners can approve or reject access requests.
Progress Validation: Validates task completion based on schedules and due dates.

4. Rewards and Penalties
Task Rewards: Users are rewarded for completing tasks as per the schedule.
Penalties: Penalties are imposed for failing to complete tasks.

# Contract Structure
1. Core Components
DeviceStruct: Tracks the owner and access list for each device.
User: Stores user details including IPFS CID, balance, and ratings.
Request: Represents a task-related request with details like schedules and tasks left.

2. Mappings
devices: Maps device IDs to their respective DeviceStruct.
users: Maps user addresses to User structs.
viewRequest: Publicly viewable array of all task requests.

3. Events
UserRegistered: Logs user registration.
DeviceAdded: Logs device additions.
AccessGranted/AccessRevoked: Tracks access changes for devices.
TaskCompleted: Logs task completions.
TokensTransferred: Logs token transfers.

# How It Works
1. Register a User
Call registerUser(string _username, string _ipfsCID) to register a new user with a username and IPFS CID.

2. Add a Device
Use addDevice(uint256 deviceID) to add a device. The caller is assigned as the device owner.

3. Send a Request
Call SendRequest(address _toUser, uint8 _days, uint256 _fromDate, uint256 _toDate, uint256 _deviceID, uint256 rewardAmount) to create a task request.

4. Validate Progress
Use validateProgress(uint256 requestID, uint256 dateNoted) to validate task progress and calculate rewards/penalties.

# Deployment
1. Install the required tools:
Node.js: v12.18.3 or later
Truffle: v5.11.5
Ganache: v7.9.1
Solidity: v0.8.0 or later

2. Clone the repository:
'git clone <repository-url>'
'cd <repository-folder>'

3. Compile the smart contract:
truffle compile

4. Deploy to a local blockchain:
truffle migrate --network development

5. Run tests:
truffle test

# Usage
Interact with the contract using:

Remix IDE: Deploy and interact with the contract directly from the browser.
Truffle Console: Use the Truffle development console for interaction.
Frontend Integration: Integrate with a web interface using Web3.js.

# Future Improvements
Integrate oracles for external task validation.
Enhance scalability for large datasets using IPFS.
Implement a frontend dashboard for user interaction.
